|	TWHL COMPETITION 34 "HALF-LIFE REIMAGINED" ENTRY	|
|								|
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| SUMMARY:							|
|								|
| Early morning, two days after a "routine experiment" tore	|
| asunder the very fabric of our reality. Since the Incident,	|
| military units from the USMC Hazardous Environment Combat	|
| Unit (HECU) have arrived at the Black Mesa Research Facility	|
| in force. Many of the BMRF employees who had survived the	|
| chaos immediately following the Resonance Cascade surged	|
| topside, expecting safety but finding themselves staring down	|
| gun barrels. It seems the government, for whatever reason,	|
| wants to ensure there are no survivors at Black Mesa, and the	|
| highly trained troops	of the HECU are efficiently, although	|
| begrudgingly, carrying out their orders. Of particular	|
| interest is a young MIT graduate working in Sector C -- the	|
| so-called "Ground Zero" of the Resonance Cascade. In the face	|
| of mounting resistance, both human and alien, HECU forces	|
| have called in the big guns, establishing tactical		|
| strongpoints with armor support at strategic locations like	|
| the main entrance to the Lambda Complex. Supposedly this	|
| "Gordon Freeman" intends to reach the Lambda Complex, and the	|
| HECU plans to eliminate this thorn in their side once and for	|
| all...							|

| DEV NOTES:							|
|								|
| Peak R_Speeds are around 1250. This map uses stock assets.	|
|								|
| This map was built over the course of about a week for the	|
| GoldSrc engine (Half-Life 1 Deathmatch). A DM reimagining of	|
| C2A5B (the first tank battle in Surface Tension), this is	|
| actually my second attempt at this map -- the first one had a	|
| bad layout and was causing too many problems with efficient	|
| VIS calculations during compile (it ran for six hours before	|
| I decided "to hell with this"...) This new iteration ran	|
| great, though; full compile took less than ten minutes.	|
|								|
| Normally I don't plan anything at all with my maps; they just	|
| -happen-. This is probably the closest I've ever gotten to	|
| working from a preexisting plan. Seems to have turned out OK.	|
|								|
| Went pretty crazy with details for some reason... maybe I got	|
| into the spirit of competition? *shrug* yay for excessive and	|
| pointless details though (like the usable and breakable water	|
| dispenser and fully-modeled vehicle interiors...)		|
