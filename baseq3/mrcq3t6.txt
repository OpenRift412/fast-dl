Addtional Info		: The OSP version of this map utilizes notffa and nottournament 
			  keys (thanks to a|rhea) which allows osp to use only one bsp version.
			  The pk3 for VQ3 release includes separate bsps for tourney and ffa play.
			  The only difference between the two modes is weapon respawn times and a regen in ffa.
			  tourney is mrcq3t6 (15 sec respawns)
			  ffa is mrcq3t6_ffa (standard 5 sec respawns)
