------- Description -----------------------------------------------------------
_______________________________________________________________________________

Windsong Keep was my entry into the Maverick Servers and Gaming Mapping
Competition #3 for Quake 3 Arena, held in the Summer of 2011, where it
placed second.

This final map has been edited slightly from the competition entry and the
sponsor logos have been removed.
