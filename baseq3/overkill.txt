NOTE: 
This version of Overkill! is a re-release. I normally never do re-releases but as some
bugs were exploitable, I figured that this one was in order.

Update info:
+ I fixed the clip errors which allowed people to walk over the skies and roofs etc.
+ I also added team play support because so many people asked me to include it.
+ I also changed the .shader name to get rid of possible future shader overwrites
  (You can sleep now, ztn) ;]
