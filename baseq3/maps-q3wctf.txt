Threewave CTF Addon for Quake3: Arena
-------------------------------------

Thank you for downloading the ThreeWave CTF Addon for Quake3: Arena.  Featuring three all new CTF levels to enhance your online experience in playing the Capture The Flag portion of Quake3: Arena.

Installation
------------

Please run the self extracting archive and change the directory to where you installed Quake3: Arena.  If you are doing a manual installation, please make sure the file twpak0.pk3 is in the baseq3 folder in your Quake3 installation folder.

This addon features three new CTF levels.  They are:

q3wctf1 "Bloodlust"  . . . . . . Large size CTF map suitable for 16 players
q3wctf2 "Courtyard Conundrum"  . Medium size CTF map suitable for 10 players
q3wctf3 "Finnegan's Revenge" . . Medium size CTF map suitable for 12 players

In order to use this addon after installation, go to the multiplayer portion of the game and either join a server with one of the above listed maps, or start a new one using the Create server option.

Server Operators
----------------

Included with this addon are two server configuation scripts.  They are:

twctf.config - This configures a standard 16 player CTF server that autorotates through the three maps in this addon.

twctfall.config - This configures a standard 16 player CTF server that autorotates through the three maps in this addon, and the existing four CTF maps that come with Quake3: Arena.  This results in a seven map rotation.

For Threewave maps only:

quake3.exe +set dedicated 2 +set com_hunkmegs 18 +exec twctf.config

For Threewave/id maps:

quake3.exe +set dedicated 2 +set com_hunkmegs 24 +exec twctfall.config

You may extract either of this files and modify them as you see fit to customize your server.  The twpak0.pk3 file is a standard ZIP archive and you may extract files from using using a standard zip file utility.

If you do extract the config files, be sure to rename them otherwise the game will use the existing ones and not your modified versions.
