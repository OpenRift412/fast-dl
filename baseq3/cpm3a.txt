- Notes -
Built with Pro Mode in mind, and inspired by Quake's DM4 it is a high-performance map. 
It was used extensively (over Q3DM6 and Q3DM13) by US players in the Lansanity Pro Mode
Tournament (July 2000).  It's since been used in every CPM tournament all over the world
and is seen by many as the proving ground for CPM 1v1 play.

The remix by swelt changes nothing about the gameplay, but adds a fresh look to this 
classic CPM tourney map.  There are also several bot optimisations (no affect to humans).
