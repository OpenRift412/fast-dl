- Notes -

This map is optimised for CPMA TDM.

Bot Play is pretty rank.  They won't go for several major items, but
I wasn't prepared to make architecture compromises to make them better.
I've "cheated" a bit to get them to take some, but for the best bot
experience, use CPMA, set bot_challenge 1 and set bot_boost 1.2 or 1.3.

This is the fifth in the series of maps dedicated to CPM Clan Nobles
