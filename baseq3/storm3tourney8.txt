Contact info:	justiningels@hotmail.com
Gametypes:	tourney, 2v2 tdm, and small FFA. 
To play:	Map will show up in your menu.  However, you can type /map storm3tourney8 <enter>.

Textures:	Evil8 texture set by Evil Lair:  evillair.net
Skybox:		Skybox courtesy of HipShot:  http://www.zfight.com/

Gameplay notes:	There are a couple skill jumps, one from RG to YA platform.  
		The jump pad behind the rail gun has two destinations. 	If you jump on the back of 
		the pad, you will bump your head on the ceiling and land on the 2nd level.  If you hit 
		the front of the pad, you are taken to the 3rd level.  This is not an error.

Thanks to:	Evil Lair for the textures, Hipshot for the skybox.  Maverick Servers for running the competition, the contest sponsors,
		the judges, my fellow competitors, and everyone involved.  Phantazm11 and Pappy-R for some last minute help :)
