information:

tourney:          1on1
team deathmatch:  2on2
Bot File (aas):   yes
other:            This map requires CPMA as it contains a green armor.
		  There are also jumps for CPM so I recommend playing it
		  in CPM - though it is playable in VQ3 aswell.

how to play:      place ct3dm5.pk3 in your baseq3/ folder
                  start quake3 
                  hit ~
                  type \map ct3dm5
                  type \addbot <botname> <skill>

                  hit ~ (to clear the console)
                 
                  OR select Left Behind(ct3dm5) from the skrimish menu. 

============================================================
This map has been created for the quake 3 mapping competition #2 
hosted by maverickservers.com. (http://mapping.maverickservers.com/)
I always wanted to create a map using a quake2 texture theme, 
so I decided to take evillair's eq2 texture set and use it for this level. 
During the contest I had a couple of moments where I wondered if the 
quality of the eq2 set can compete with all the high res textures you 
can use nowadays - I even started to retexture it but in the end I went
back to the eq2 set because of the feedback from the forums (thanks).
Now, where the map is done I can say that I'm happy with the textures
and the overall look of the map.
